/**
 *  <b>Title:</b> GMT_MapException<p>
 *  <b>Description:</b> Exception thrown when Error occurs while using GMT to generate the
 * PSHA and Shakemaps,such as trying to set invalid depths, such as a negative number<p>
 *
 * Note: These exception subclasses add no new functionality. It's really
 * the class name that is the important information. The name indicates what
 * type of error it is and helps to pinpoint where the error could have occured
 * in the code. It it much easier to see different exception types than have one
 * catchall Exception type.<p>
