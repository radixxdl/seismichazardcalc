/**
 * <b>Title:</b> DiscretizedFuncAPI<p>
 *
 * <b>Description:</b> Interface that all Discretized Functions must implement. <P>
 *
 * A Discretized Function is a collection of x and y values grouped together as
 * the points that describe a function. A discretized form of a function is the
 * only ways computers can represent functions. Instead of having y=x^2, you
 * would have a sample of possible x and y values. <p>
 *
 * This functional framework is modeled after mathmatical functions
 * such as sin(x), etc. It assumes that there are no duplicate x values,
 * and that if two points have the same x value but different y values,
 * they are still considered the same point. The framework also sorts the
 * points along the x axis, so the first point contains the mimimum
 * x-value and the last point contains the maximum value.<p>
 *
 * Since this API represents the points in a list, alot of these API functions
 * are standard list access functions such as (paraphrasing) get(), set(),
 * delete(). numElements(), iterator(), etc.<p>
 *
 * There are three fields along with getXXX() and setXXX() matching the field
 * names. These javabean fields provide the basic information to describe
 * a function. All functions have a name, information string, and a
 * tolerance level that specifies how close two points have to be along
 * the x axis to be considered equal.<p>
 *
 * Point2D = (x,y)<p>
 *
 * Note: This interface defines a tolerance so that you can say two x-values
 * are the same within this tolerance limit. THERE IS NO TOLERANCE FOR THE
 * Y-AXIS VALUES. This may be useful to add in the future.<p>
