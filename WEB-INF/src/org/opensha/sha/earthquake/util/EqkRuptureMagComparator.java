	 * Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or
	 * a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
	 * The implementor must ensure that sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x))
	 * for all x and y. (This implies that compare(x, y) must throw an exception if
	 * and only if compare(y, x) throws an exception.)
	 * The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive:
	 * ((compare(x, y)>0) && (compare(y, z)>0)) implies compare(x, z)>0.
	 * Finally, the implementer must ensure that compare(x, y)==0 implies that
	 * sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z)) for all z.
	 * It is generally the case, but not strictly required that
	 * (compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any
	 * comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact.
	 * The recommended language is "Note: this comparator imposes orderings that
	 * are inconsistent with equals."
	 * @param object1 Object the first object to be compared.
	 * @param object2 Object the second object to be compared.
	 * @return int a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer
